# Elevate Labs Internship - Task 6: Password Strength Analysis

This repository contains the deliverables for Task 6 of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship. The task focuses on understanding and evaluating password security.

### **Objective**
The goal was to understand what makes a password strong, test various passwords against strength-checking tools, and document best practices for password security.

### **Files in this Repository**
* `report.md`: A detailed report covering the password evaluation results, research on common attacks, and a summary of password security best practices.
* `/screenshots`: A folder containing the results from testing multiple passwords of varying complexity on an online password strength meter.

### **Process Overview**
1.  Created a series of passwords with different characteristics (weak, predictable, complex, passphrase).
2.  Tested each password using the online tool `passwordmeter.com`.
3.  Took screenshots of the strength score and feedback for each test.
4.  Researched common password attacks like Brute-Force and Dictionary attacks.
5.  Compiled the findings into a comprehensive report.

### **Key Concepts Covered**
* Password Strength & Complexity
* Brute-Force Attacks
* Dictionary Attacks
* Password Security Best Practices
* Authentication Concepts
